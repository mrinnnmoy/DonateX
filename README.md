# DonateX

Transparent Donation Matching and Automated Payment Workflows for Web3 Fundraising.

## ⚠️ Problem to Solve. 

It’s hard for donors to see where their money goes, especially in matched donations. Nonprofits struggle to manage and distribute funds fairly. Existing tools don’t work well with crypto and require a lot of manual effort.

There’s a need for a simple platform that makes donations and fund distribution clear, automatic and secure for everyone.

## ✅ Possible Solution.

**DonateX** is a user-friendly platform that simplifies donation matching and fund distribution through:

1. **Transparent Matching**: Automatically matches donations and shows donors how much has been matched, with real-time progress updates.

2. **Automated Payouts**: Releases funds to nonprofits automatically based on milestones, reducing manual work and ensuring transparency.

3. **Easy Donations**: Allows users to donate in crypto or via credit card, making it accessible for everyone.

4. **On-Chain Tracking**: Keeps all donation records visible on the blockchain, building trust and accountability.
