# DonateX

Transparent Donation Matching and Automated Payment Workflows for Web3 Fundraising.

![DonateX-Home](./client/public/donateX-website-design/1.png)

## ⚠️ Problem to Solve. 

It’s hard for donors to see where their money goes, especially in matched donations. Nonprofits struggle to manage and distribute funds fairly. Existing tools don’t work well with crypto and require a lot of manual effort.

There’s a need for a simple platform that makes donations and fund distribution clear, automatic and secure for everyone.

## ✅ Possible Solution.

**DonateX** is a user-friendly platform that simplifies donation matching and fund distribution through:

1. **Transparent Matching**: Automatically matches donations and shows donors how much has been matched, with real-time progress updates.

2. **Automated Payouts**: Releases funds to nonprofits automatically based on milestones, reducing manual work and ensuring transparency.

3. **Easy Donations**: Allows users to donate in crypto or via credit card, making it accessible for everyone.

4. **On-Chain Tracking**: Keeps all donation records visible on the blockchain, building trust and accountability.

2. Set up wallet integration.
3. Write and deploy the smart contract on the blockchain.
4. Integrate IPFS for storing campaign details.
5. Implement The Graph for querying campaign and donation data.
6. Create donation and campaign creation workflows on the frontend.
7. Set up automated fund transfers using Streamflow.
8. Add notification system using Push Protocol.
9. Test, debug and deploy the application.

**3.** Make necessary changes and commit those changes. <br />
Remember never push anything to the Main branch. <br />

Always change your branch to "develop" using:

    git checkout develop

Again check your current branch using:

    git branch

It should point \*develop

Now add your changes using:

    git add files-you-edited

If there are multiple files you can use:

    git add .

Now create a commit message using:

    git commit -m "<commit-message-goes-here>"

**4.** Push changes to GitHub

    git push origin develop

**5.** Create a Pull Request 👋<br>

Now you go to your repository on GitHub, you’ll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button and now write a summary of what changes you have done.( Attach images if required). I will review your code and merge it if it passes all the tests.❤️
